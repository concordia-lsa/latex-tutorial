\begin{document}

This is the first paragraph.

\section{Section Heading}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item this
    \item is
    \item a numbered list
\end{enumerate}

This is the second paragraph.
This is \textbf{still} the second       paragraph.
\textit{Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.}

Now here's a third paragraph.

\begin{itemize}
    \item an
    \item unordered
    \item list
\end{itemize}

Here's a table:\\

\begin{tabular}{r|cc}
    &$-$back&$+$back\\
    \hline
    $+$high&i&u\\
    $-$high&e&o\\
\end{tabular} \\

This is a gloss made with the \texttt{gb4e} package:

% The Greek script requires a work-around using XeLaTeX. If you can't figure it out, comment out these lines (by adding % to the beginning of the line) -- you will also need to comment out the next three lines because the gb4e code will break when you comment the first line

\gll ὕδορ μεν ἄριστον\\
	hudor men ariston\\
    water-\textsc{nom.sg.neut} but best-\textsc{nom.sg.neut}\\
\glt `Water, however, is best.'\\

Here's a syntax tree made with the \texttt{forest} package:

\begin{forest}
    [IP
        [NP[Noam Chomsky,roof]]
        [I'
            [I\\(past)]
            [VP
                [VP
                    [V[wrote]]
                    [NP[\textit{Syntactic Structures},roof]]
                ]
                [PP
                    [P[in]]
                    [NP[1957,roof]]
                ]
            ]
        ]
    ]
\end{forest}
